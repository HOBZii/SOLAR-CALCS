Solar System Calculator

## Overview
This is a comprehensive solar system calculator designed to help users calculate solar panel, inverter, and battery requirements for different solar applications.

## Features
- Supports three system types:
  1. On-Grid
  2. Hybrid
  3. Pumping System

- Bilingual support (English and Arabic)
- Calculates:
  - Number of solar modules
  - Inverter size
  - Battery capacity

## Calculation Parameters
- Panel Wattage: Default 585W (customizable)
- Load Requirements: Minimum power needs
- Backup Time: Desired hours of backup
- Battery Voltage: 12V, 24V, or 48V options

## Calculation Methodology
The calculator uses the following key assumptions:
- Average peak sun hours: 5.5 hours/day
- System efficiency: 75%
- Depth of discharge: 50%
- 20% overhead for inverter sizing

## How to Use
1. Select your preferred language
2. Choose the system type
3. Enter minimum load requirements
4. Specify desired backup time
5. Click "Calculate"

## Notes
- For hybrid systems, the calculator provides a baseline estimation
- Actual system design may require professional consultation
- Results are approximate and should be verified by a solar professional
